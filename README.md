# Windows Command Scripts


This set of cmd files do cool little things that you can do with Window's command prompt.

## matrix.bat
This generates matrix like cmatrix. Very cool!

## appFolder.cmd
This script opens a folder that contains shortcuts to all programs installed on your PC. This isn't a folder thats in your drive, rather it's a secret super-folder. DO NOT execute in Powershell becuase it won't work. Rather, use it in Command Prompt with admin priveleges.

## fakevirus.cmd
This is a funny prank to play on your friend. All it does is execute a bunch of dialogs "warning" you of a deadly virus on your computer. This does not affect your system at all.

## signout.bat
It signs you out. Make sure you save your work before trying this script!

## WriteEXE.cmd
This simply executes the command:
  write.exe
It's basically like typing WordPad in your search and opening it.
